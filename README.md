This project demonstrates how low-level keyboard and mouse events can be intercepted at the system level for learning and research purposes.
Just a low-level program to track keyboard and mouse clicks
run the file on your windos and as you run,there appears an play and pause buttons on top of your screen.
which are used to pause and resume the logging activity, and as you run,all the buttons you have pressed on you keyboard and all the clicks clicked on your mouse will be recorded
After you terminate the program, "readme" saves in the folder in which this program is ran
and in the readme file,all the information will be logged.
